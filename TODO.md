## High priority:
- [ ] Have to fix the loading screen! When you submit the user account, it takes a second! Use HTMX loading (like in the reddit example) to give it modern feel while it works async.
- [ ] Fix up HTMX and Tailwind for production (do not use cdn)!
- [ ] Hook-up stripe
- [ ] Hook-up email service (for password resets, etc.)
