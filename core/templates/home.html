    <h2 class="text-xl">What is Papers?</h2>
    <p>The internet is overflowing with information—too much for any one person to handle. And while technology demands more of our attention, true learning requires focus.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">Papers is a solution. We're offering a service to sort through the noise and deliver the most valuable information to you—into your hands, in a physical format—which you can fold up, tear up, un-staple and re-staple, mark up with pencil and pen, and spill coffee on. No screens. No distractions.</p>
